# https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/

# Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of 
# two given nodes in the tree.

# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest 
# common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest 
# node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node 
# to be a descendant of itself).”

class Node:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        pass
def lowest_common_ancestor(tree_node, p, q):
    return
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(lowest_common_ancestor())
